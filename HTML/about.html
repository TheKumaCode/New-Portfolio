                <p> 
                    I'm Robertas. I'm a junior developer. I've been interested in programming for a long time. <br class="line-br">
                    Even before I knew about programming I was interested in jobs in game development. <br class="line-br">
                    In highschool I did computing but the coding in that class was at most stuff like scratch so it wasn't a very accurate experience of programming. <br class="line-br">
                    In college however I tried the both the art side (Games Design) and the programming side (Computer Science) and enjoyed the programming side more. <br class="line-br">
                    In college the main language taught was JavaScript, and they touched on HTML and CSS.  <br class="line-br">
                    During my final project for computer science I made a game using C# and C++, although it wasn't taught in class I learnt it in my spare time. <br class="line-br">
                    Outside of that, I also made a few projects in my spare time, such as a converter one using JavaScript, which I later remade using C++ and C# to make a better UI. <br class="line-br">
                    I also customised profiles using CSS on sites that allowed it.
